    <br>
    <p class="text">My name is Kevin, I am 24 years old, and I am in my second semester of software development engineering. I would like to acquire the knowledge to devote myself to this for the rest of my life.
        This is because, since I was a child, I have always liked technology and have been fascinated by what has been created thanks to it. My dream is to be one of those people, creating or assisting in a large project.
